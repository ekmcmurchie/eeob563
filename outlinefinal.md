**Background and Study Aims**

  In “Paraphyly in the Bamboo Subtribe Chusqueinae (Poaceae: Bambusoideae) and a Revised Infrageneric Classification for Chusquea” (Fisher *et al.* 2009), phylogenetic analysis of five coding and noncoding loci found that the genus *Chusquea*, which contains over two hundred and eighty species of neotropical woody bamboos, was embedded within the much smaller *Neurolepis*, an Andean genus of woody bamboo known for its lack of aerial branching and large leaves up to four meters long. This study also found that the genus *Chusquea* as it was then defined fell into the clades Euchusquea and *Chusquea* belonging to subgenus *Rettbergia*. *Chusquea sensu stricto* had also previously been found to be supported by molecular data. Due to the paraphyly of the subtribe as it was then defined, Fisher *et al.* 2009 were faced with several options: split the subtribe *Chusqueinae* into multiple genera, including two for the former genus *Neurolepis*, or combine *Neurolepis* and *Chusquea* into a single, large, morphologically heterogeneous genus. As there were no clear morphological distinctions between the two clades of *Neurolepis*, Fisher *et al.* 2009 chose the latter option, moving all species of *Neurolepis* into the genus *Chusquea*. At the time, this was controversial, due to the clear morphological distinctions between the former *Neurolepis* and *Chusquea*.

  A previous study, “Phylogenetic Relationships Among the One-Flowered, Determinate Genera of Bambuseae (Poaceae: Bambusoideae)”, by Clark *et al.* (2007), examined a larger set of bamboo species. Clark *et al.* 2007 found that, using a strict consensus of eight maximum parsimony trees based on 98 morphological and anatomical characters, Neurolepis was basal to most other bamboo species and separate from the clade containing most *Chusquea*. However, as this study excluded many of the *Neurolepis* later considered by Fisher *et al.* 2009, it may not give a full picture of the morphological distinctions and similarities that could exist between different clades of former *Neurolepis* and *Chusquea*.

  In this study, I plan to use an abbreviated set of some of the morphological characters used in Clark *et al.* 2007, as well as a few additional characters, to determine whether the species examined in Fisher *et al.* 2009 would have a similar topographic placement using a maximum parsimony analysis of morphological characters as they did using Bayesian probabilities based on chloroplast DNA sequence data. I will also use Bayesian probabilities based on morphological characters to see if a similar tree to that found using Bayesian probabilities based on chloroplast DNA sequence data will be found. 


**Methods**

  I plan to use the same 20 morphological characters for all of the 26 species, giving a total of 520 characters that I will record for these species. Most of these morphological characters come from Clark *et al.* 2007. A few characters that I plan to use that are not found in Clark *et al.* 2007 are variable characters found in former *Neurolepis* that I hope will shed light on the phylogenetic relationships of these species within *Chusquea*. 
  
  The morphological characters that I plan to use that are found in Clark *et al.* 2007 include: 1. Culm branching: 0  = no aerial branching; 1 = aerial vegetative branching present. 2. Primary buds per mid-culm node: 0  = one; 1 = two or more; 2 = none. 3. Central bud shape: 0 = triangular; 1 = circular (dome-shaped). 4. Branching pattern: 0 = intravaginal; 1 = extravaginal; 2 = infravaginal. 5. Culm leaf blade shape: 0 = broadly triangular; 1 = narrowly triangular; 3 = lanceolate (pseudopetiolate). 6. Culm leaf blade midrib abaxially: 0 = indistinguishable; 1 = visible. 7. Culm leaf blade-derived appendages on the sheath summit: 0 = no true auricles or fimbriae; 1 = efimbriate auricles present; 2 = fimbriate auricles present; 3 = fimbriae only present. 8. Foliage leaf sheath: 0 = rounded on the back; 1 = strongly keeled at least near the apex. 9. Foliage leaf midrib placement: 0 = centric; 1 = excentric (wider side of the base greater or equal to 1.3 times as wide as the narrower side. 10. Symflorescence form: 0 = open paniculate (at least main axis elongated); 1 = capitate-paniculate; 2 = racemose; 3 = solitary spikelet; 4 = spicate. 11. Spatheate bracts subtending the whole synflorescence: 0 = absent; 1= one or more present. 12. Number of glumes (in female-fertile spikelets or spikelets proper): 0 = absent; 1= one; 2 = two; 3 = three; 4 = four; 5 = five or six. 13. Awns on the lower two glumes: 0 = absent; 1 = present. 14. Rachis extension (internode only, with or without rudimentary spikelet: 0 = absent; 1= present and short (less than length of floret); 2 = present and long (greater than length of floret). 15. Palea apex 0 = biapiculate (sinus shallow); 1 = tips long-divided (sinus deep); 2 = 1-keeled; 3 = acute, not divided. 16. Sulcus: 0 = well developed for full length of palea; 1 = well developed only toward the apex; 2 = absent.
  
  Additional morphological characters that I plan to use include: 17. Culm leaf oral setae: 0 = absent; 1 = present. 18. Foliage leaf oral setae: 0 = absent; 1 = present. 19. Foliage leaf outer ligule: 0 = present; 1 = absent. 20. Foliage leaf sheath summit extension: 0 = absent; 1 = present, unfused to inner ligule; 2 = present, fused to inner ligule. 
  
  To determine the character states of each species, I will refer to Clark *et al.* 2007 when possible, and when not, to the descriptions of the species. Unfortunately, no complete online repository of species descriptions exists. Characters from descriptions will therefore be taken from their original publications when possible, and when not possible, from later publications. If certain characters cannot be found in these publications, I will use digitized herbarium images, or if possible, herbarium specimens, to determine their character states. 
  
  To create a phylogenetic tree based on these morphologic characters, I will create a matrix using the morphological data. Then I will use PAUP* to construct a majority-rule consensus tree based on 1000 bootstrap replicates of the most parsimonious trees. I will also use MrBayes to determine a Bayesian estimation of the phylogenetic tree using the Standard Discrete Model, which can be used for morphology. I will use the default of two independent analyses with four chains each, and a MCMCP diagnostic frequency of 1000, with the diagnostic stat set to maximum standard deviation. I will then compare the resulting trees to the topology of the tree given in Fisher *et al.* 2009 and see whether I obtain a similar or different result.
